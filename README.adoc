=== Build
There is no build step now.

=== Release

NOTE:  Requires '/p/swamp' to build/release

* Update `release/RELEASE_NOTES.txt` with release notes

* Update variable `DEST_DIR` in the `Makefile` for release directory. _This is only required to be done once when you clone the repository_.

* Update variable `VERSION` in the `Makefile` for the current `X.Y.Z` version

* Commit the source code to `git`

* Create a tag with the command: `git tag releases/X.Y.Z`

* Run commands: `git push` and `git push --tags`

* run `make` or `make VERSION=<X.Y.Z>`, this will copy all the files for the release in a directory named `script-assess-X.Y.Z` in `Makefile:$DEST_DIR`
